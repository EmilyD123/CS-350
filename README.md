    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    Our final project was to utilize the TI Simplelink Launchpad and Code Composer Studio to create a functioning thermostat using the onboard temperature sensor. The program needed to use the peripherals I2C to read the temp, GPIO to control the LED and read input on the buttons, and UART to read the data. 
    What did you do particularly well?
    I had to do a good amount of research and troubleshooting because the standard UART driver was not available for my device and sdk configuration, so I had to use the UART2 driver, which has different parameters and call functions, so I had to change a lot. I think I did well making it work.
    Where could you improve?
    I need to do better reaching out for help when I need it. This project, as well as previous projects, took entirely too long because of a combination of procrastination and stubborness. 
    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    Online classes feel very isolating to me, which translates to a feeling that I need to figure out everything on my own, when the truth is that I have instructors, classmates, and school resources I can lean into. It's hard to remember that, but when I finally did reach out in this class, it was a huge relief. So, I'll certainly remember that going forward.
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    My ability to read technical manuals/literature improved so much while working with the TI Launchpad. It was very frustrating at first, but now I feel confident referencing the various manuals. That skill will certainly be transferable in and out of coursework.
    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Modular functions, clarifying comments, descriptive variable names, and standardized drivers -- all contribute to a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program :)
